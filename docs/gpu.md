# The GPU and the Neural Engine in containers

Two devices, each a CDI device name on `docker run`, both on by default and both costing nothing until a container uses them (`lighter config --gpu off`, `--ane off` to remove them).

## Vulkan: `--device lighter.dev/gpu=all`

The guest has a virtio-gpu render node. Nothing else: no display, no cursor, one capset, Venus, which is Vulkan serialised over the virtqueue and decoded on the host by virglrenderer's Venus renderer on top of MoltenVK, on the Mac's own GPU. A container needs Mesa's Venus driver, which the distributions package (`mesa-vulkan-virtio` on Alpine, part of `mesa-vulkan-drivers` on Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora), plus the Vulkan loader:

```bash
docker run --rm --device lighter.dev/gpu=all alpine:edge sh -c \
  'apk add mesa-vulkan-virtio vulkan-loader vulkan-tools && vulkaninfo --summary'
#   deviceName = Virtio-GPU Venus (Apple M1)
```

What runs on it is whatever speaks Vulkan: llama.cpp's Vulkan backend, whisper.cpp, stable-diffusion.cpp, ncnn, ONNX Runtime's WebGPU provider. Measured on an M1 with four vCPUs, Qwen2.5-0.5B (Q4_K_M), `llama-bench -p 128 -n 32`:

| where | prompt, t/s | generation, t/s |
|---|---:|---:|
| container, Vulkan | 1028 | 45 |
| container, CPU | 329 | 21 |
| native macOS, Metal | 1923 | 99 |
| native macOS, CPU | 229 | 79 |

PyTorch is not on this list: on Linux it has no Vulkan backend, so a container's `torch` stays on the CPU (the `lighter.dev/mps` device is the answer for PyTorch, below).

**How it is built.** The renderer is statically linked; `host/gpu/build.sh` builds virglrenderer (Venus only, render server as a thread) against the MoltenVK release archive into `host/out`, and the VMM's `build.rs` links what it finds there. Two patches are carried: the guest kernel places host-visible blobs on 16 KiB boundaries (Apple silicon's page; stock Mesa then works unchanged, `guest/kernel/patches/0031`), and virglrenderer gets an eventfd where macOS has none (`host/gpu/patches/0001`), without which its fence thread never runs and every Vulkan wait hangs.

**What it costs.** A blob the guest maps is a Metal buffer placed into guest-physical space by the hypervisor, in an 8 GiB aperture of address space above RAM; it belongs to the renderer and is never counted as guest memory. The renderer initialises when the driver probes, at boot: about 10 MB and two threads on an idle machine, the guest kernel's DRM about 3 ms of boot.

## The Neural Engine: `--device lighter.dev/ane=all`

A container's ONNX Runtime loads lighter's plugin execution provider, `/usr/lib/lighter/liblighter_ane_ep.so`, which claims the model's graph, serialises it and sends it to the host, where ONNX Runtime's CoreML provider runs it, on the Neural Engine where it can. The provider links no libc, so the one file loads in any image.

```python
import onnxruntime as ort
ort.register_execution_provider_library("lighter", "/usr/lib/lighter/liblighter_ane_ep.so")
devices = [d for d in ort.get_ep_devices() if d.ep_name == "LighterANE"]
options = ort.SessionOptions(); options.add_provider_for_devices(devices, {})
session = ort.InferenceSession("model.onnx", options)
```

The model crosses at the first run, when its input shapes are known: the Neural Engine takes only bound shapes, so the provider binds the model's inputs to that run's dims (and rebinds if they change). Nodes with subgraphs (`If`, `Loop`) stay on the container's CPU provider. ResNet-50 on an M1: 1.76 ms an inference on the Neural Engine, against 30 ms on the CPU and 7.9 ms on the GPU through CoreML.

**How it is built.** `host/ane/build.sh` builds ONNX Runtime with the CoreML provider as static archives into `host/out/ort`; `guest/ane-ep/build.sh` builds the provider. The host service is a loopback TCP port the container reaches through the streams (`lighter.ane=<port>` on the kernel command line, `LIGHTER_ANE` in the container); ONNX Runtime is loaded on the host at the first model, not at boot.

## Gates

`make gate-m9` (Vulkan: vulkaninfo through the CDI device), `make gate-m10` (an ONNX model through the plugin provider, outputs checked against the CPU). Both need `docker` on the Mac and pull an image.
